# prepaid

A new Flutter project.

## Abstract

https://kundenkonto.lidl-connect.de/ is a huge website
that simply does not load on limited internet connection.

So it is almost impossible to top up your plan or buy a data package
when the internet limit is already reached.

## Implementation

Basic functionality is a list of phone numbers and data limits.
Lidl connect is a plugin.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application that follows the
[simple app state management
tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple).

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Assets

The `assets` directory houses images, fonts, and any other files you want to
include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware
images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).

## Localization

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in
the `lib/src/localization` directory.

[Internationalizing Flutter
apps](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization)
